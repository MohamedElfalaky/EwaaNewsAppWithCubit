API : a link , when i call it, i could (get-post-update-delete) the data from
the data base which is hosted on a server.

API : is separated into to parts

1- Domain / Host / BaseURL : https://newsapi.org (اساسي+ ثابت)
2- End point : /v2/everything (اساسي+ متغير)
3- query params : ?q=tesla&from=2024-02-25&sortBy=publishedAt&apiKey=7c07f0c86d484b30a5af1289c531cff1 (غير اساسي+ متغير)

q : "",
from: date,
sortBy: "",
apiKey: ""

{
"ans": "KSA",
"score":1
}

- the response that comes from api is on the form of JSON object (java script object notation) (Map)
- JSON object ----> Dart object (Model)

how to fetch data from API ?
1- make a model : to transfeer json object to a Dart object (to make a Model)

2- make a repository: call API to get the response.

3- Handle the proccess using state management

//////////////////

Cubit

- cubit is a state management method (set state)
- setstate renders the whole screen , cubit renders the part that i want to render only.
- cubit used to separate buisness logic from the ui
- cubit is a Archtictural patteren used to make clean code and clean archticture , How?
  by preventing the presentation layer to connect with the data layer directly.

how to use :
1- create the cubit and the state (you can use the extension which is name is bloc)
2- add a provider for the cubit (register the cubit/bloc)
3- handle the logic inside bloc/cubit and state
4- wrap the rendered part with BlocBuilder()
